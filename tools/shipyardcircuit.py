"""The Pacific Shipyards Circuit, long layout (the user's): ~2 km round Pacific Shipyards' lots.

From the lap line on the upper road (west of Turn 2), the forward way round:

  1. the upper road south-east to Turn 2, and on out of it along side road 31;
  2. right onto side road 04, south-west then south;
  3. across the gap south of it to side road 39's east end (nothing is drawn there: a tunnel
     is to hide that);
  4. side road 39 west to Pacific Shipyards II's start road, and up it north to the junction;
  5. the strip north-west from the junction between the lots to the old road by the concrete
     barricade;
  6. a hairpin right onto the old road, east to the kink and the upper road.

The side roads, the gap and the strip are off the course: drawn only (the strip and the gap not
even that), so they get road, walls and visibility here, as the first layout's link did
(tools/shipyardloop.py, whose pieces this reuses).
